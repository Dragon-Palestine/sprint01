## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

---

## Available Scripts

* `npm run dev` – Start development server with hot module replacement
* `npm run build` – Build optimized production bundle
* `npm run preview` – Preview production build locally
* `npm run lint` – Check code quality with ESLint

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Feature-Based Organization

* Groups all related files (components, hooks, utilities, styles) for each feature together
* Improves maintainability, scalability, and team collaboration
* Simplifies adding or removing features
* Promotes component reusability

### Module Exports

```javascript
// Instead of:
import SearchBar from "./features/employees/components/SearchBar";
import FilterPanel from "./features/employees/components/FilterPanel";

// You can write:
import { SearchBar, FilterPanel } from "./features/employees/components";
```

### Performance Optimization

* Uses `useMemo` hook for filtering large datasets
* Components properly split for React optimizations
* CSS organized to minimize bundle size

---

## Styling

### Global Styles (`src/styles/globals.css`)

* CSS variables for consistent theming
* CSS resets and base styles
* Dark mode support

### Feature Styles (`src/features/[feature]/styles/`)

* Component-specific styles
* Co-located with components for easy maintenance
* BEM-like naming conventions

---

## Browser Support

* Chrome (latest)
* Firefox (latest)
* Safari (latest)
* Edge (latest)

---

## Contributing

1. Follow the established file structure
2. Keep components small and focused
3. Co-locate styles with components
4. Use JSDoc comments for documentation
5. Maintain the naming conventions
6. Test new features before committing

---

## Development Best Practices

* **Component Naming** – PascalCase for components
* **File Organization** – Keep related files together in feature folders
* **Exports** – Use `index.js` files for clean exports
* **Documentation** – Add JSDoc comments to components and utilities
* **Scalability** – Add new features in `src/features/[feature-name]`

---

## Performance Notes

### Handling 1000+ Employees

* Memoized filtering with `useMemo`
* Grid-based CSS layout
* Optimized component rendering

### Memory Optimization

* Employee data generated once at app startup
* Filtering memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
* No external API calls (data generated locally)
